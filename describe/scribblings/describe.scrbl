This library provides functions to describe Racket objects. Currently, the following types of objects are described:


@margin-note{This is not the official version of Describe. It is the 1.5 version from PLaneT, retooled to use Racket's current package system, but with bigfloats disabled (because of incompatibility with v.5.3) and extflonums disabled (because of incompatibility with Racket CS). Under Racket CS, I've found that complex numbers with inexact coefficients for the imaginary part also seem to crash. Maybe stay away from those. The canonical version of Describe is on the @link["http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=describe.plt&owner=williams" "PLaneT server"]. — MB}

@section{Interface}

The describe library provides the following functions:

@defproc[(variant (x any/c)) symbol?]{
Returns a symbol identifying the type of @scheme[x]. This is from a post on the Racket mailing list from Robby Findler. The following is a short description of its origin:

... I'm not sure about always, but at some point a while ago, Matthew decided that all values are structs (in the sense that you could have implemented everything with structs and scope, etc even if some of them are implemented in C) and adapted the primitives to make them behave accordingly.}

Examples:

@scheme[(variant (λ (x) x))] -> procedure

@scheme[(variant 1)] -> fixnum-integer

@scheme[(variant (let/cc k k))] -> continuation

@scheme[(variant (let/ec k k))] -> escape-continuation

@defproc[(integer->string (n exact-integer?)) string?]{
Returns a string with the name of the exact integer @scheme[n]. This works for exact integers whose magnitudes are less than 10^102. For values whose magnitudes are greater than or equal to 10^102, the string "at least 10^102" (or "minus at least 10^102") is returned.}

Examples:

@scheme[(integer->string 0)] -> "zero"

@scheme[(integer->string (expt 2 16))] -> "sixty-five thousand five hundred and thirty-six"

@scheme[(integer->string (expt 10 100))] -> "ten duotrigillion"

@scheme[(integer->string (expt 10 150))] -> "at least 10^102"

@defproc[(float->string (x (or/c flonum? single-flonum?))) string?]{
Returns a string with the exact decimal value of the floating-point number @scheme[x]. This works for single precision, double precision, and extended precision values. Note that internally @scheme[x] is converted to an exact rational number as part of converting to a string.}

Examples:

@scheme[(float->string 0.0)] -> "0.0"

@scheme[(float->string 1.0)] -> "1.0"

@scheme[(float->string 0.1s0)] -> "0.100000001490116119384765625"

@scheme[(float->string 0.1)] -> "0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625"

@scheme[(float->string 0.1t0)] -> "0.1000000000000000000013552527156068805425093160010874271392822265625"

@defproc[(describe (x any/c)) void?]{
Prints a description of @scheme[x] to the current output port.}

Examples:
@scheme[(describe (sqrt 10))] @linebreak[]
@schemefont{3.1622776601683795 is an inexact positive real number}

@scheme[(describe (sqrt -10))] @linebreak[]
@schemefont{0+3.1622776601683795i is an inexact positive imaginary number}

@scheme[(describe #\a)] @linebreak[]
@schemefont{#\a is the character whose code-point number is 97(#x61) and general category is 'll (letter, lowercase)}

@scheme[(describe '(this is a proper list))] @linebreak[]
@schemefont{(this is a proper list) is a proper immutable list of length 5}

@scheme[(describe car)] @linebreak[]
@schemefont{#<procedure:car> is a primitive procedure named car that accepts 1 argument and returns 1 result}

@defproc[(description (x any/c)) string?]{
Returns a string describing @scheme[x].}

@section{Issues and Comments}

There are undoubtably object types that I have missed and, since Racket is a language that is being actively developed, new object types are sometimes added. If you come across something that is missing, either send me an e-mail or post it on the Racket mailing list.

The @scheme[describe] function should probably have an optional or keyword argument to specify the output port.

It would be nice to come up with a way to allow developers to extend the describe library for new object types. Perhaps via something like a @schemefont{prop:custom-describe} structure type property.
