## Project status

Maintained, for some sense of that word. I didn’t write this code. This is a copy of a project that lives on Racket’s PLaneT servers, adjusted so it works with Racket’s current package-server system and Racket CS (which after v8.0 is just “Racket”). I don’t know how this code works and don’t even use this package anymore. But as long as it continues to demand almost nothing of me, I suppose I am maintaining it. But if there were a change to Racket that broke this package in a major way, I would let it die. No question.
